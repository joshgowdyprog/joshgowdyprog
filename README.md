Hi, I’m @joshgowdyprog. I'm learning machine learning and data science in general, with aim of becoming a data scientist. 
I studied Maths followed by a masters in theoretical physics @ University of Oxford graduating in 2019. 
I then completed a PhD in theoretical physics at Queen Mary University of London in 2024, specialising in quantum field theory, black holes and gravitational waves.
