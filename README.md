Hi, I’m Josh. I am a data scientist. I completed a PhD in theoretical physics at Queen Mary University of London in autumn 2024, specialising in gravitational wave physics, black holes and quantum field theory. Before that, I studied mathematics at undergraduate level followed by a masters in theoretical physics both at University of Oxford graduating in 2019.

I have since worked on a handful of projects in the energy sector involving: 

* graph-theoretic linear optimisation solutions for modelling GB electicity networks
* computer vision (deep) learning algorithms for optical character recognition of technical engineering diagrams

This repo contains some additional personal and professional projects of mine. Some highlights:

* Bayasian modelling and inference with supernova data including Monte Carlo Markov Chains
* Forecasting and trading GB energy markets with machine learning
