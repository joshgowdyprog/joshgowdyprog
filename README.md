Hi, I’m Josh. I am a data scientist. I completed a PhD in theoretical physics at Queen Mary University of London in autumn 2024, specialising in gravitational wave physics, black holes and quantum field theory. Before that, I studied mathematics at undergraduate level followed by a masters in theoretical physics both at University of Oxford graduating in 2019.

I have since worked on a handful of projects in the energy sector involving: 

* modelling power flow on GB electicity networks (uses graph-theoretic, linear optimisation methods)
* building a bespoke computer vision (deep) learning model for optical character recognition and clustering of information within old engineering diagrams

This repo contains some additional personal and professional projects of mine. Some highlights are:

* Bayasian modelling and inference with supernova data including Monte Carlo Markov Chains
* Forecasting and trading GB day-ahead energy markets with machine learning (Logistic and XGBoost)
