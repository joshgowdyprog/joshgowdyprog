Hi, I’m Josh. I am a data scientist. I completed a PhD in theoretical physics at Queen Mary University of London in 2024, specialising in gravitational wave physics, black holes and quantum field theory. Before that, I studied mathematics at undergraduate level followed by a masters in theoretical physics both at University of Oxford graduating in 2019. 

Leveraging these foundations, I am determined to use my broad skill set to solve the problems of the future and provide real insight and impact with the power of data.

This repo contains some personal and professional projects of mine.
