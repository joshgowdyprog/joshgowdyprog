Hi, I’m @joshgowdyprog. I am a data scientist with a strong analytical background and experience as a project lead in the energy sector. I have a PhD in gravitational physics encompassing 4 years experience in model building and inference. Leveraging these foundations, I am determined to use my broad skill set to solve business problems and provide real insight and impact with the power of data.

I studied maths at undergraduate level followed by a masters in theoretical physics both at University of Oxford graduating in 2019. 
I then completed a PhD in theoretical physics at Queen Mary University of London in 2024, specialising in gravitational wave physics, black holes and quantum field theory.
